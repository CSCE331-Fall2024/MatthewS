                    <h2>Technical Skills:</h2>
                    <p> The coding language I am most experienced with is C++, but I have used extensively various other languages such as Python, Ocaml, 
                        Racket, Ruby, and HTML/CSS. I am also knowledgeable in Git and have a solid understanding of various software developmental 
                        methodologies for collaborative teamwork, such as agile and waterfall. While I am open to learning new technologies, I have 
                        gained an interest in machine learning and AI.

                    <h2>Career Interests:</h2>
                    <p> With AI's prevalence in todayâ€™s society, it has become a prominent focus of my future career goals. Its ability to simplify daily, 
                        routine tasks and to enhance everyday experiences is far too evident. Additionally, I am drawn to companies specializing in space 
                        exploration or similar pursuits, and I even originally planned to study aerospace engineering. However, while I do have a 
                        noticeable interest in various fields relating to computer science, I have yet to find a topic that does not intrigue me 
                        and I would not be willing to learn.
