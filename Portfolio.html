                <p>Dungeons Crawlers is a game run in a compiler's terminal. It was specifically created to enhance and develop dynamic memory management skills and to teach game logic implementation. 
                    It emphasized key programming concepts such as creating and storing values in <a href="https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/271614/" 
                    class="port-links">2D dynamic arrays</a>, resizing those same arrays, 
                    and ensuring proper deallocation of memory to avoid memory leaks. As the player traverses through the various dungeons, 
                    the program must efficiently manage dynamic memory to update the game states, in other words, the board.</p>

                    The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of

                    (OOP) by working on a Tetris game. While I did not create the Tetris game itself, 
                    I enhanced key aspects of Tetris, such as adding more shapes, making a button that turns the piece 180 degrees, and a cheat button that turns the current piece into a 1x1 at 
                    the cost of points. Instead of directly altering the parent classes, the project utilized subclassing to add to the existing game, emphasizing only to take what was required 
                    from the original code. This path preserved the original game while also highlighting inheritance in OOP.

                <p>
                    I have created the classes for a variety of <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/in/web-pro-in/8-basic-data-structures-every-programmer-should-know" class="port-links">data structures</a> 
                    including binary trees, hash-maps, skip lists, linked lists, priority queues, binary heaps, stacks, queues, and more. 
                    These projects have given me a comprehensive understanding of the most optimal data structure given a specific task as I understand 
                    the time and space complexities for the various functions implemented within them. Additionally, I have learned numerous sorting algorithms, 
                    and have even coded some myself, such as quick sort, merge sort, insertion sort, shell sort, counting sort, bucket sort, and more. 
                    Understanding when these specific algorithms are strong and weak is a vital tool for maintaining efficiency within programs and ensures I select the best algorithm for the task at hand.
