                <h2>Construction</h2>
                <p>Over the past three summers, I have worked in construction, gaining hands-on experience in various tasks such as repairing fascia, building 
                    deck roofs, and operating a skid steer to level ground. My work in the small town of Centerpoint, TX, has enhanced the aesthetic appeal of 
                    several homes, contributing to increased tourism at the nearby river and boosting overall traffic through the city.

                <h2>Working On Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Having a working level of knowledge in repairing vehicles, many people have asked me to fix their cars, which I often do for a significantly 
                    cheaper price than that of a mechanic shop, if not for free. For example, I recently changed a friend's alternator in their car for free, which was 
                    located in a severely annoying spot (picture above). In this instance and several others, I have allowed people to return to their daily lives without the fear of financial burden.

                <h2>Painting</h2>
                <p>Similar to my experience with cars, I have also provided painting services at a significantly lower cost. I have painted three homes, 
                    including one nearly entirely on my own, which took me 2-3 weeks. My process involves thorough scraping, caulking, and painting, which 
                    has not only helped homeowners reduce financial stress but, in one case, contributed to an increased selling price of their home.

                <h2>Campus Org's</h2>
                <p>Although I have not yet been involved in many on-campus organizations, I am eager to join some to enhance my portfolio and gain valuable experience. 
                    The TAMUG Coding Club is relatively new at A&M Galveston, but I am interested in contributing to its projects. My goal is to assist new Computer 
                    Science students and identify and address campus issues through collaborative projects that benefit the entire campus community.</p>
