                <h2>Construction</h2>
                <p>Over the past three summers, I have worked in construction, gaining hands-on experience in various tasks such as repairing fascia, building 
                    deck roofs, and operating a skid steer to level ground. My work in the small town of 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Point,_Kerr_County,_Texas" class="service-links">Centerpoint,</a>
                    TX, has enhanced the aesthetic appeal of 
                    several homes, contributing to increased tourism at the nearby river and boosting overall traffic through the city.

                <h2>Working On Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Having a working level of knowledge in repairing vehicles, many people have asked me to fix their cars, which I often do for a significantly 
                    cheaper price than that of a mechanic shop, if not for free. For example, I recently changed a friend's 
                    <a href="https://www.firestonecompleteautocare.com/blog/maintenance/what-does-an-alternator-do/" class="service-links">alternator</a> 
                     in their car for free, which was located in a severely annoying spot (picture above). In this instance and several others, 
                     I have allowed people to return to their daily lives without the fear of financial burden.

                <h2>Painting</h2>
                <p>Similar to my experience with cars, I have also provided painting services at a significantly lower cost. I have painted three homes, 
                    including one nearly entirely on my own, which took me 2-3 weeks. My

                    involves thorough scraping, caulking, and painting, which has not only helped homeowners reduce financial stress but, in one case, 
                    contributed to an increased selling price of their home.

                <p>Although I have not yet been involved in many on-campus organizations, I am eager to join some to enhance my portfolio and gain valuable experience. 
                    The <a href="https://www.aggiecodingclub.com/" class="service-links">TAMUG Coding Club</a> is relatively new at A&M Galveston, but I am interested in contributing to its projects. My goal is to assist new Computer 
                    Science students and identify and address campus issues through collaborative projects that benefit the entire campus community.</p>
